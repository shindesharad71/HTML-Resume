Universal Résumé Template
---------

Minimal and formal résumé (CV) website template for print, mobile, and desktop. The proportions are the same on the screen and paper. Built with amazing [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

[Letter Size Demo](https://universal-resume.netlify.com/) | [A4 Size Demo](https://universal-resume-a4.netlify.com/) | [Multiple Pages Demo](https://universal-resume-pages.netlify.com/) | [Mobile Demo](https://www.responsinator.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Funiversal-resume-pages.netlify.com%2F)

**How to print or save it as PDF?**  
In Chrome, Right-click → Print. In Firefox, File → Print. More info [here](#printing).

**Does it support A4 and Letter paper sizes?**  
Yes, replace all `-letter` classes with `-a4`, and uncomment specified code blocks. More info [here](#a4-size-variant).

**Why it’s made?**  
I couldn’t find any formal or professional résumé (CV) website with good typography that is optimized for the Web, print, PDF, and mobile. Also, researching what recruiters want, my priorities were fast scanning time and all content to fit on one page.

How to run it
---------

Navigate to the base directory:

```
cd universal-resume
```

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```
npm run serve
```

Only generate CSS that is used on the page, which results in much smaller file size:

```
npm run public
```

Starting Point
---------

`public/index.html` is the main content file. By copy-pasting HTML — add pages, sections, subsection, etc.

`npm run public` will make **public** directory ready for drag-n-drop to for example https://app.netlify.com/drop (registration required beforehand).

Tailwind CSS
---------

Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override. It has great [documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

Compose together a bunch of pre-made utility classes that reflect a certain design system. There’s minimal cascade and selector specificity. This results in faster and much more pleasurable workflow, especially in the long term.

Custom CSS
---------

Code from `tailwind.config.js` and `tailwind.css` transpiles to `public/style.css`. Default tailwind CSS is overwritten or extended with `tailwind.config.js`.

Here is the default tailwind config: [defaultConfig.stub.js](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss/blob/master/stubs/defaultConfig.stub.js), and here’s the additional information about it from the Tailwind documentation: [theme](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme/#app).

If you want to change CSS in the classical way, add a class to the HTML element and write CSS inside `tailwind.css`.

Balanced Columns
---------

Removing `col-fill` class will make both columns equally tall. Moreover, removing `md:h-letter` and `md:h-letter-col` classes will eliminate fixed proportions of the letter or A4 page — thereby removing unnecessary vertical space when displaying short columns.

A4 Size Variant
---------

Change the default (letter) size to A4:

**1.** Inside `public/index.html`, replace every `-letter` with `-a4`.

**2.** Inside `tailwind.config.js`, uncomment code block below `/* For A4 size */` and then comment code block below `/* For Letter size */`

**3.** Inside `tailwind.css`, comment code below `/* For Letter size */` and uncomment code below `/* For A4 size */`

**Important:** Too much content for one page will break it in form of additional columns.

Printing
---------

### Chrome

Right-click → Print.  
Also, choose the **Save as PDF** option if needed.

By expanding **More Settings**, change **Page Size** to A4 or Letter.

### Firefox

File → Print.

Choose A4 or Letter size by navigating to **Properties → Advanced → Paper Size**.

### Adobe Acrobat Reader

File → Print.

By clicking on the **Page Setup** button, you are taken to the window to choose A4 or Letter size.

Blocking Search Engines
---------

Disable search engine indexing by adding the following code to the document `<head>`:

```
<meta name="robots" content="noindex">
```
